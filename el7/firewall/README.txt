Firewall scripts for Red Hat Enterprise Linux & CentOS
======================================================

(c) Niki Kovacs 2019 

This repository provides a variety of firewall template scripts for servers
running Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS.

Three different contexts are covered:

  * public : Internet facing server 

  * router : LAN router

  * simple : standalone LAN server

Install the required iptables and iptables-services packages, since the
scripts rely on them.

Remove the conflicting firewalld package.

Choose the directory most suited to your configuration (public, router or
simple) and copy the firewall.sh script to a sensible location like your
~/bin directory. 

Edit the handful of variables at the beginning of the firewall.sh script to
adapt it to your network configuration.

Next, check out the section marked # Add various services here # in the
script. You'll probably want to add services like DNS, web, mail, proxy, file
sharing, directory services, etc. The respective services subdirectories
provide template stubs for the most common services, which you can copy and
paste into the script. 

Start the firewall:

  $ sudo ./firewall.sh --start

Stop the firewall:

  $ sudo ./firewall.sh --stop

Display the current status:

  $ sudo ./firewall.sh --status

The router version contains an extra --nat option which enables IP
masquerading without starting the firewall:

  $ sudo ./firewall.sh --nat

Last but not least, the public server version properly integrates fail2ban if
it's installed on your system.
